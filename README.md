# Working Portfolio

## Purpose
A mock-up of my own website to show-case my work and skills learned through out this course and beyond!

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS

###This project was built to highlight skills learned in advanced CSS. The repository name is 'furikakeru' which is Japanese for sprinkles.
I chose this name because adding 'sprinkles' is a metaphor for adding flair to HTML with CSS. 
Furikake is usually a mix of bonito flakes, nori, and sesame seeds that is great to add on top of a dish for a blast of umami. üçö I had food on the mind while making this repo.
Thanks for reading!
